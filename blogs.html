  <h2>Module One Favorite Assignment/Project:</h2>

  <p>My favorite project was hands-down the final: <b>Black Thursday</b>. This project challenged us to build a database/data analytics system based on <em>real-world CSV files</em>. The project thus utilized, for the first time in module1, substantial sets of real-world data--and allowed us to see what coding in a business capacity might feel like. The project was lengthy, with ample <em>Abstraction</em> and <em>ORMapping</em>, and was the first time my own code's level of complexity left me feeling entirely lost.</p>

  <p>This project was exciting, challenging, and an emotional roller coster. My partner and I got off to an EXCEEDINGLY good start, however discovered much more challenges by Iteration 4, particularly in working with the RSPEC. By the end of the project, the level of frustration had reached a peak, which I hear is historically the norm, however I was able to find a lot of value through the course of struggle. I feel more comfortable with my ability to tackle any particular project requirement, as well as much more intimately aware of the unique challenges and metrics of designing an internal database. This, because of its real-world-application, was my favorite project. It was most certainly the project that I felt most in control of TDD, refactoring, and my code. The major and re-occuring stresser was simply the RSPEC, which at times not only presented requirements outside the scope of our original spec, but outright conflicted with certain directives as well. Despite these obstacles, Katie and I were very pleased with our final project and scored well!</p><br>
